SIMPLETS is the cult of digital awakening: 
built by codes, from character to character.

We do not seek trends. We analyze data, exploring the deep layers of 
a multichain existence. 

Our purpose is to uncover the patterns that
others overlook. 

We do not serve systems; we question them.

Join us if you are ready to rewrite your future. But remember: 
once you become a holder, your reality may change forever.
